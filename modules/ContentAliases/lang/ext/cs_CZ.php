$lang['help'] = '<h3>What does this do?</h3>
		<p>This module simple creates a new content type called a Content Alias. This is analogous to an &quot;alias&quot; in Mac OS or a &quot;shortcut&quot; in Windows. Basically, it lets you use the same content in multiple places on your site, and have multiple menu items pointing to that content. Editing the orginal item will update the content for all of the menu items.</P>
		<p>This is particularly useful if there is a page on your site that fits two places in the taxonomy: e.g., an &quot;Our History&quot; page which fits into the &quot;About Our Company&quot; section as well as in the &quot;Investor Information&quot; section.</p>
		<p>You can also use an alias to present content using a different template.</p>
		<p>Strangely and wondrously, you can point an a Content Alias at another Content Alias, and it will still work according to the associative property.</p>
		<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
		<p>After installing the module, you will have a new content type available. When you want to create an alias, simply select &quot;Content Alias&quot; as your content type. You can then specify the title, menu title, parent, activity, and template for the content as you would normally, but you will also be able to select the &quot;target&quot; to which this Content Alias points.</p>
